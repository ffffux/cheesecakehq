## Ingredients ##
* all ingredients, except the ones with special annotations, should be at room temperature)

### Crust ###

    200 grams (2 cups) of graham cracker crumbs
    50 grams (1/4 cup) white sugar
    115 grams (1/2 cup) melted butter

### Filling ###

    900 grams (32 ounces) cream cheese
    200 grams (1 cup) white sugar
    3 tablespoons all purpose flour
    5 large eggs
    80 ml (1/3 cup) heavy whipping cream
    1 tablespoon organic lemon zest
    1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract

### Topping ###

    240 ml (1 cup) sour cream
    2 tablespoons white sugar

### tools, pans, stuff ###

    1 springform pan (23 cm / 9 inches)
    a little butter for the pan
    electric mixer  (a whisk is also fine)
    one large bowl
    a dough scraper
    some spoons
    an oven
    a fridge

## Preparation ##

1. grease your springform pan with the butter
2. preheat your oven (350 degrees F, 180 degrees C)

### Crust ###

1. mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter in your bowl.
2. put them into your springform pan, press them evenly on the ground and, if you want to, about 2.5 cm (1 inch) up the sides. I usually use a glass or a spoon for this.
3. put the pan into your fridge.
4. clean your bowl.

### Filling ###

Note: To avoid getting too much air into your filling, it's important to beat the filling just as long as absolutely necessary until all ingredients are mixed well, and not longer than this. If you do so, you'll get a smooth, soft filling for your cake.

1. put all the cream cheese into your bowl and mix it until it's smooth.
2. add sugar and flour, beat for about 2 minutes.
3. add the eggs (one at a time) and beat well (about 30 s per egg).
4. add whipping cream, lemon zest and vanilla extract and beat.
5. Pour the filling in your prepared crust, smoothen the surface with a spoon or your dough scraper and put your cake in the oven. Now ...

### Bake it! ###

- ... for 15 minutes
- After 15 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 120 degrees C (250 degrees F) 
- and continue to bake for another 60-90 minutes.

### How do I know when my cheesecake is done? ###

It's done when it's set and firm and the center of the cake is still a little wobbling when you shake the pan. Now ...

### The topping ###

1. Combine sour cream and sugar. 
2. Spread the topping over the warm cheesecake 
3. and return it to the oven to bake for 15 more minutes.

### A little trick for the finish ###

- Remove your cake from the oven and carefully run a sharp knife around the inside edge of the pan to loosen the cheesecake from the pan (this helps preventing the surface from cracking).

- Let your cake cool completely before serving (best is overnight). 

# And now: enjoy! #
