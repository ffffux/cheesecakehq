# Chocolate Cheesecake #

Created with tons of good chocolate and cream cheese, this is a special one. We love it most in winter when it's cold and dark outside, but if you really love chocolate, this may be your all-year-favourite.

## Ingredients ##
* all ingredients, except the ones with special annotations, should be at room temperature)
* please use full fat ingredients, darling. Low-fat is not cool.

### Crust ###

    125 grams (1 1/3 cups) of graham cracker crumbs
    1 tablespoon cocoa
    60 grams soft butter

### Filling ###

    170 grams (6 ounces) dark chocolate (bittersweet or semisweet)
    500 grams cream cheese
    150 grams sugar
    1 tablespoon custard powder
    3 large eggs
    3 large egg yolks
    150 ml sour cream
    0.5 tablespoon cocoa powder (dissolved in 1 tablespoon hot water)
    
### Special Feature: Topping ###

    75 grams dark chocolate
    125 ml double cream
    1 teaspoon golden syrup 

### tools, pans, stuff ###

    1 springform pan (23 cm / 9 inches)
    a little butter for the pan
    electric mixer  (a whisk is also fine)
    one large bowl
    a dough scraper
    some spoons
    an oven
    a fridge

## Preparation ##

1. grease your springform pan with the butter
2. preheat your oven (350 degrees F, 180 degrees C)

### Crust ###

1. mix graham cracker crumbs, cocoa and butter in your bowl until it makes damp crumbs.
2. put them into your springform pan, press them evenly on the ground. I usually use a glass or a spoon for this.
3. put the pan into your fridge.
4. clean your bowl.

### Filling ###

Note: To avoid getting too much air into your filling, it's important to beat the filling just as long as absolutely necessary until all ingredients are mixed well, and not longer than this. If you do so, you'll get a smooth, soft filling for your cake.

1. melt the chocolate for your filling (170 grams)
2. put all the cream cheese into your bowl and beat it until it's smooth.
2. add sugare and custard powder, mix in.
3. add the whole eggs (one at a time) and the yolks beat well (about 30 s per egg).
4. add the sour cream.

### Now, if you want to ... ###

put 3/4 cup of the filling aside. You can use it later for some layer effects like on the picture above. If you're not in the mood for effect-stuff, just continue with your 

### Filling, part 2 ###

4. add cocoa dissolved in hot water and melted chocolate and mix.
5. Pour the filling on your prepared crust and smoothen the surface with a spoon or your dough scraper.
6. If you put some of the light filling aside before, now pour it onto the dark filling. You may also want to add some pattern. For the later, just put small drops of the light filling onto the dark one, take a fork or a chopstick and draw circles, lines or whatever you want to (the results are different, so just try out).
7. Now put your cake in the preheated oven and

### Bake it! ###

- ... for 15 minutes
- After 15 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 120 degrees C (250 degrees F) 
- and continue to bake for another 60-70 minutes.

### How do I know when my cheesecake is done? ###

It's done when it's set and firm and the center of the cake is still a little wobbling when you shake the pan. Now ...

### A little trick for the finish ###

- Remove your cake from the oven and carefully run a sharp knife around the inside edge of the pan to loosen the cheesecake from the pan (this helps preventing the surface from cracking).
- Let your cake cool completely before adding the topping and serving (best is overnight). 
- And finally put it on a serving plate.

### Add the topping ###

1. Melt the topping-chocolate gently with cream and syrup.
2. When it's nearly melted, take off the heat and whisk it to a smooth sauce.
3. let it cool a little and pour it over the cheesecake (you can also draw some pattern with it)
4. If there's some topping left, just serve it with the cake (or just eat it as is :) )

# And now: enjoy! #
