# Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake

This is based on a Cheesecake recipe I found on [BBC Good Food](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1759649/peanut-butter-cheesecake) with a slight modification as I could never get the topping to set as per their instructions. The end product reminds me a lot of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which is always A Good Thingâ„¢.

_DISCLAIMER:_ There are so many calories in a single serving of this cheesecake, you should eat this responisibly and definitely with other people!

### For the base

    100g butter
    350g pack peanut cookies

### For the filling

    5 gelatine leaves
    500g tub ricotta
    175g smooth peanut butter
    175g golden syrup
    150ml milk

### For the top

    A big bar of milk chocolate (or more!)

### Tools, pans, stuff

    20cm round cake tin
    Rolling pin
    Large heatproof bowl
    Pan
    Sealable bags
    Stick blender

## Insructions

1. Oil and line a 20cm round cake tin with cling film, making it as smooth as possible. Melt the butter in a pan. Crush the biscuits by bashing them in a bag with a rolling pin, then stir them into the butter until very well coated. Press the mixture firmly into the base of the tin and chill.

2. Soak the gelatine in water while you make the filling. Tip the ricotta into a bowl, then beat in the peanut butter and syrup. Use a stick blender to make the mixture smooth.

3. Take the soaked gelatine from the water and squeeze dry. Put it into a pan with the milk and heat very gently until the gelatine dissolves. Beat into the peanut mixture, then tip onto the biscuit base. Chill until set.

4. Melt the chocolate as per [the instructions here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/techniques/melting_chocolate) (that's the method I use, anyways), and once it's ready, coat the top of the cheesecake with the chocolate. Put it in the fridge to set (again).

5. To freeze, leave in the tin and as soon as it is solid, cover the surface with cling film, then wrap the tin with cling film and foil.

To defrost, thaw in the fridge overnight.
